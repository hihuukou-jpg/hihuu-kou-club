# Enhancement Plan: CONTENT Section (Video Gallery)

## Goal
Transform the current simple video list into a premium video gallery. This includes replacing direct iframe embeds with high-quality thumbnails to improve performance and aesthetics, and implementing a "Lightbox" (modal) player for a cinematic viewing experience.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will use standard YouTube thumbnail URLs (e.g., `mqdefault.jpg`, `maxresdefault.jpg`) to generate previews automatically from the video ID. No manual image upload is required for videos.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [NEW] `components/VideoModal.js`
- A reusable modal component to play videos.
- Features:
    - Backdrop blur overlay.
    - Exit animation.
    - Responsive video player container.

#### [MODIFY] [components/VideoSection.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/VideoSection.js)
- **Current State**: Renders a grid of `iframe` elements directly.
- **Changes**:
    - Extract YouTube ID from URL (already implemented, but will refine).
    - Render `img` tags (thumbnails) instead of `iframe`.
    - Add a "Play Button" overlay on hover.
    - Implement state to track the `activeVideo` (the one currently playing).
    - Render `VideoModal` when a video is selected.
    - Improve grid styling for a more cohesive "gallery" look.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Gallery View**: Check if thumbnails load correctly for all registered videos.
- **Interaction**: Click a video -> Modal opens -> Video plays.
- **Closing**: Click outside modal or 'X' button -> Modal closes -> Video stops.
- **Responsiveness**: Verify layout on mobile (single column) vs desktop (grid).
