# Enhancement Plan: Character Section (Hakurei Shrine Theme)

## Goal
Redesign the Character Section to align with a "Cute Hakurei Shrine" atmosphere, moving away from the current dark cyber/tech aesthetic. The new design will emphasize traditional Japanese elements, shrine colors (Red/White), and a softer, more welcoming presentation.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will change the entire background of this section to be brighter (Japanese paper texture/White) to contrast with the dark "Hero" section, creating a dynamic visual rhythm.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [components/CharacterSection.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/CharacterSection.js)
- **Background**: Change from dark blue/tech to a "Washi" (Japanese paper) texture with subtle Sakura (cherry blossom) patterns.
- **Layout**:
    - **Mobile**: Swipeable card view.
    - **Desktop**:
        - Left: Vertical list of "Ema" (wooden plaques) serving as character tabs.
        - Right: Large character illustration with a "Scroll" (Makimono) style description box.
- **Visual Elements**:
    - Remove rotating tech rings.
    - Add floating Sakura petal animations.
    - Change fonts to predominantly Serif / Mincho for a traditional feel.
    - Use "Hakurei Red" (`#B91C1C` / `var(--hakurei-red)`) and "Shinto White" for the color palette.

#### [NEW] `components/SakuraBackground.js` (Optional/Inline)
- A lightweight compiled CSS animation for falling cherry blossom petals to add interactivity and "cuteness".

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Theme**: Verify the visual shift from "Cool/Tech" to "Cute/Traditional".
- **Responsive**: Ensure the "Ema" tab list transitions smoothly to a mobile-friendly layout.
- **Animations**: Check that sakura petals fall smoothly without causing lag.
