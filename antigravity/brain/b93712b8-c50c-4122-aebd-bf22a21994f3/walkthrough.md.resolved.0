# Video Gallery Enhancement Walkthrough

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Video Gallery Layout ([components/VideoSection.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/VideoSection.js))
- **Grid Layout**: Videos are now displayed in a responsive grid that adapts to screen size.
- **Thumbnails**: Replaced direct iframe embeds with high-resolution YouTube thumbnails (`maxresdefault`).
- **Performance**: Page loads faster because it doesn't need to load multiple YouTube players on startup.
- **Micro-interactions**: Added hover effects (scale up, shadow, play button overlay) to make it feel clickable.

### 2. Lightbox Player ([components/VideoModal.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/VideoModal.js))
- **Cinematic Viewing**: Clicking a video opens it in a full-screen "Lightbox" modal with a dimmed background.
- **Focus**: The backdrop blur keeps the user focused on the video.
- **Animation**: Smooth entry/exit animations using `framer-motion`.

## Verification Results

### User Verification Required
