# Refinement: Character Section (Design Polish)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Reverted Image Size & Layout
- **Restoration**: Returned the character image to the previous larger size (`height: 100%`) as per user feedback ("previous size was good").

### 2. Design Improvements ("Better Design")
- **Soft Float Animation**: Added a gentle up-and-down floating animation to the character image to make it feel alive and less static.
- **Bottom Fade Mask**: Applied a `mask-image` gradient to fade out the bottom 15% of the character image. This solves the "angular/cut-off" issue where the image meets the floor.
- **Paper Glow Effect**: Added a subtle white glow + drop shadow filter to give a "high-quality paper cutout" feel, enhancing the "Hakurei Shrine/Washi" theme.

## Verification Results

### Automated Checks
- [x] **Server Start**: Next.js server running on port 3000.
- [x] **API Health**: `/api/characters` returning data correctly.

### User Verification Required
Please open the website and inspect the "CHARACTERS" (登場人物) section:
1.  **Size**: Is the character image big enough again?
2.  **Animation**: Do you see the gentle floating motion?
3.  **Edges**: Does the bottom of the image fade out smoothly instead of a hard cut?
