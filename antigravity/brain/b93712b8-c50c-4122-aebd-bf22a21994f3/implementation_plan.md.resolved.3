# Refinements & Entrance Animation Plan

## Goal
Improve usability of BGM and Omikuji, and add a dramatic "Fusuma" (sliding door) entrance animation with sound to the landing page.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. BGM Player Refinement ([components/BgmPlayer.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/BgmPlayer.js))
- **Volume Control**: Add a vertical or horizontal slider (`<input type="range">`) to adjust volume from 0 to 1.
- **UI**: Show slider on hover or toggle.

### 2. Omikuji Refinement ([components/Omikuji.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/Omikuji.js))
- **Dismissible**: Add a "Close" (X) button to the result display so users can hide it after reading.

### 3. Fusuma Entrance (`components/FusumaGate.js`)
- **Visuals**:
    - Two large panels (Left/Right) covering 100vw/100vh.
    - Texture: Japanese paper (Washi) + Wood frame styling.
    - Center handle (Hikite).
- **Animation**:
    - On mount: Slide `x: 0` to `x: -100%` (left) and `x: 100%` (right).
    - Duration: ~1.5s - 2s easing.
- **Sound**:
    - Play a "Sliding Door" sound effect (`fusuma_open.mp3` placeholder) immediately on load.
    - We will try to autoplay; if blocked, it plays as soon as possible.
- **Integration**:
    - Add to [app/page.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/app/page.js) as the top-level component.

## Verification Plan
1.  **BGM**: Slide volume, check if audio level changes.
2.  **Omikuji**: Draw fortune, click X, verify it disappears.
3.  **Fusuma**: Reload page -> See doors -> Hear sound -> Doors open -> Revealing Hero section.
