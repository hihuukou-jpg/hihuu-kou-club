# Enhancement: Character Section (Hakurei Shrine Theme)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Theme & Atmosphere
- **Previous**: Dark, cyber/tech simplistic layout.
- **New**: "Hakurei Shrine" inspired traditional Japanese aesthetic.
- **Background**: White/Grey custom radial gradient mimicking "Washi" (Japanese paper) texture.
- **Animations**: Added falling Sakura (cherry blossom) petals using Framer Motion.

### 2. Layout & UI Components
- **Tabs (Left)**: Designed to look like "Ema" (wooden plaques).
    - Selected tab glows with "Hakurei Red".
    - Hanging string visual added (desktop only).
- **Description Box (Right)**: Designed to look like a "Makimono" (Scroll).
    - Wrapped in a glass-morphism container with traditional color accents.
    - Vertical text styling for roles (Japanese style influence).
    - Fonts updated to Serif/Mincho for a more elegant look.
