# Winter Theme Redesign Plan

## Goal Description
Redesign the website to match the atmosphere of the provided New Year/Winter illustration. The image will be used as the Hero background, and the overall color scheme will be updated to reflect the "Winter Shrine" aesthetic.

## User Review Required
None specifically, but visual changes are significant.

## Proposed Changes
### Global Styles ([app/globals.css](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/app/globals.css))
- [ ] **Update Color Palette**:
    - `hakurei-red`: Adjust to a deeper, Torii-like red (keep or slightly darken).
    - `hakurei-white`: Change to a snowy off-white (`#F8F9FA`).
    - Add `winter-navy`: `#2F3E46` (for text or accents).
    - Add `pine-green`: `#2D4F3F` (nature accent).
    - Add `warm-gold`: `#E6C229` (festive accent).

### Hero Component ([components/Hero.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/Hero.js))
- [ ] **Update Background**:
    - Replace the CSS gradient with the uploaded image (`/hero-winter.jpg`).
    - Add an overlay (gradient or semi-transparent color) to ensure text readability.
- [ ] **Update Text Style**:
    - Adjust text color to stand out against the image (likely White with Shadow).
    - Maintain the vertical Japanese text but ensure it fits the new layout (maybe move to the side if the image center is important).
- [ ] **Update Examples**:
    - Change particle effects from "Sakura" (Pink) to "Snow" (White).

### Refinement Steps
- [components/Hero.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/Hero.js):
    - [ ] Change subtitle "Winter Edition" to "Hifuu Kou" (or "Hifuu Kou Club").
- [components/Navigation.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/Navigation.js):
    - [ ] Ensure background is transparent or matches winter palette.
    - [ ] Update text colors for readability over winter backgrounds.
- [components/CharacterSection.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/CharacterSection.js):
    - [ ] Update main background to winter gradient/color.
    - [ ] Adjust circle background colors (Renko/Merry) to cool winter tones.
- [components/VideoSection.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/components/VideoSection.js):
    - [ ] Update background to matching winter style.
    - [ ] Update header border color to Deep Red or Slate.
    - [ ] Add subtle shadow/border to video cards.
