# Hifuu Kou Club Website Walkthrough

## Summary
The website has been successfully migrated to Supabase for data persistence and has undergone a complete design overhaul to match the "Winter Shrine" x "Honkai: Star Rail" aesthetic. A visitor counter has also been implemented for the admin dashboard.

## Completed Features
### 1. Winter Theme Re-design (Hifuu Kou)
- **Hero Section**: New "Winter" illustration, falling snow particles (white), and "Hifuu Kou" subtitle.
- **Global Colors**: Updated to Winter White (`#F8FAFC`), Ice Blue (`#E0F2FE`), and Hakurei Red (`#B91C1C`).
- **Hifuu Kou Branding**: "秘封工倶楽部" logo with winter styling.

### 2. HSR Style UI Integration
- **Navigation**:
    - Transparent-to-Glass effect on scroll.
    - Cyan/Gold accent lines.
    - Admin link minimized to a discreet text link.
- **Components**:
    - **News/Diary**: "Cut Corner" cards (45-degree angles) with glassmorphism.
    - **Characters**: Diamond-shaped selector buttons and rotating ring backgrounds.
    - **Videos**: Tech-inspired frames with corner accents.
    - **Animations**: Use of `framer-motion` for smooth, sci-fi entry animations.

### 3. Feature Implementation
- **Supabase Integration**:
    - All data (News, Characters, Diary, Videos) is now fetched from Supabase.
    - **Image Upload**: Admins can upload character images directly to Supabase Storage.
- **Visitor Counter**:
    - Tracks site visits in `site_stats` table.
    - Displays total visitor count on the Admin Dashboard (Admin only).

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- **Authentication**: Secured with NextAuth.js (Google/Credentials).
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create/Read/Update/Delete support for all content.
- **Stats**: Real-time visitor count display.

## Verification
- **Local Server**: Validated `npm run dev` starts successfully on port 3000.
- **API**: Verified `/api/stats` correctly increments and returns visitor counts.
- **Visuals**: Confirmed HSR-style glassmorphism and animations across all sections.

## Supabase Stats Setup
To enable the visitor counter, the following SQL was executed:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS site_stats (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  views BIGINT DEFAULT 0
);
INSERT INTO site_stats (id, views) VALUES (1, 0) ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```
