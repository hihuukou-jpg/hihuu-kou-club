## User Review Required
None identified yet.

## Proposed Changes
### Admin Panel
- [app/admin/page.js](file:///c:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/app/admin/page.js):
    - [ ] Inspect `handleCharacterSubmit` or similar function.
    - [ ] Ensure file input exists and handles file selection.
    - [ ] Ensure `FormData` is constructed correctly with the image file.

### API Routes
- `app/api/characters/route.js` (or similar):
    - [ ] Verify `POST` and `PUT` methods handle `multipart/form-data`.
    - [ ] Verify Supabase storage upload logic.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Attempt to upload an image for a new and existing character via the admin panel.
- Verify the image appears in the list and on the public site (if applicable).
