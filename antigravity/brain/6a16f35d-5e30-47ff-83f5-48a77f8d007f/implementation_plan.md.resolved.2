# Public Read-Only Admin Dashboard

Allow anyone (listeners) to view the Admin Dashboard stats/content, but restrict adding, editing, or deleting content to authenticated Admins only.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `/admin` page will now be visible to everyone. Sensitive data (if any) should be hidden. Currently, it only shows News, Characters, Diary, and Videos, which are public anyway.

## Proposed Changes

### Middleware ([middleware.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/middleware.js))
- [MODIFY] Remove `/admin` from the matcher so it is NOT automatically blocked.
- [KEEP] We still need `next-auth` to handle the actual API route protection or use client-side checks for the button actions.

### Admin Page ([app/admin/page.js](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/app/admin/page.js))
- [MODIFY] **Remove** the `useEffect` dependency on `session`. Always fetch data on mount so everyone can see it.
- [MODIFY] **Conditional Rendering**:
    - If `!session` (Guest): Show the lists (News, Diary, etc.) but **HIDE** the forms (Add/Edit) and **HIDE** delete buttons.
    - Show a "Login" button instead of "Logout" for guests.
- [MODIFY] **Login Flow**: Clicking "Login" should trigger `signIn()`.

### API Routes
- [KEEP] API Routes ([POST](file:///C:/Users/kouki/.gemini/hifuu-kou-club/app/api/news/route.js#21-47), `DELETE`) are already protected by `getServerSession` in the backend code (confirmed in previous checks). This ensures even if a hacker forces the UI to show buttons, the server will reject the request.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Open `/admin` in Incognito (Guest).
   - Should see the Dashboard content.
   - Should NOT see "Add News" forms.
   - Should see "Login" button.
2. Click "Login" -> Enter Admin Creds.
3. Redirect back to `/admin`.
   - Should see Forms and Delete buttons.
