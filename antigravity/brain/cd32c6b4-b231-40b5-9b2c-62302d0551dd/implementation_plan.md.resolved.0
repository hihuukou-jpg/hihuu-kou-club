# Implementation Plan - Hifuu Kou Club Website

Create a high-quality, animated website for "Hifuu Kou Club" (Secret Sealing Crafts Club?), a Touhou Project derivative work circle.
The design will be inspired by *Arknights: Endfield*, featuring immersive animations, a futuristic/industrial aesthetic compatible with the Hifuu Club world view, and sections for News and DevLog.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Technology Stack**:
> - **Framework**: Next.js (React) - Chosen for performance, animation capabilities, and easy routing for blog/news functionality.
> - **Styling**: Vanilla CSS - As per system preferences, providing full control over the visual design without framework constraints.
> - **Animations**: Framer Motion - Essential for complex, orchestrated animations (entry sequences, scroll triggers) required to match the "Endfield" aesthetic.
> - **Icons**: Lucide React.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Structure (Next.js)

#### [NEW] [Project Setup]
Initialize a new Next.js application.
- `app/layout.js`: Main layout with persistent navigation and smooth transitions.
- `app/page.js`: Immersive Landing Page.
- `app/news/page.js`: Announcements list.
- `app/diary/page.js`: DevLog/Diary list.
- `components/`: UI components (Navbar, Footer, Hero, PostCard).

### Design & Animations (The "Endfield" Feel)

#### [NEW] [Styles & Asset Generation]
- **Theme**: Dark, minimalist, technical. Colors: Slate/Charcoal background, Accent Cyan/Gold (fitting Hifuu), Monospaced headers.
- **Animations**:
    - **Intro Overlay**: A "loading" sequence that transitions into the main content.
    - **Parallax/Scroll**: Elements sliding into place with slight delays.
    - **Glitch/Technical Effects**: Subtle decorative elements (lines, coordinates, data readouts) to give that "Engineering/Observation" feel.

### Content Management

#### [NEW] [Data Source]
- Use local JSON or Markdown files for News and Diary entries initially to keep it simple but expandable.
- `data/news.json`
- `data/diary.json`

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Build verification (`npm run build`).
- Lint checks.

### Manual Verification
- **Visual Check**: Verify the entry animation accurately conveys the requested atmosphere.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the complex layout works on mobile.
- **Navigation**: Test routing between Home, News, and Diary.
